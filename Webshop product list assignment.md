# Webshop product list

Use the following data set: https://github.com/ArcoMul/hyf-product-list-data-set (see data.json)

We'd like you to create a product list and product detail page based on the data in the link above.

The product list shows all product with an image, title, price, and short description.

The product detail page shows one product with an image, title, price and long description.

In the product list there should be a search bar above the list where if you type some letters it will filter the product items based on these letters. A product called 'football', should also appear when typing 'ball'.

Please add filtering options to filter the products on price. This filter should use a double slider. The left handle defines the minimum price, the right handle the maximum price. Use the airbnb price filter as an example, but feel free to make it more simple.

Both the filtering and search happens dynamically, there is no page refresh or submit button involved.

Using a server and database is optional, building a client side application only is also an option.
